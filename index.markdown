Welcome. Discover all the services of our platform so that you can build or integrate your service with Kontist.

## Getting started

We provide you with a [GraphQL API](https://graphql.org) to fetch transactions or start new transfers.

First you need to [register your own application](/console) with us as an OAuth2 client, then you can use your application to create an access token to access Kontist on behalf of a user. With that access token you can make requests to our `/api/graphql` endpoint.
For an easier start we provide you with our SDK.

## Kontist SDK

Our JavaScript SDK helps you to easily connect to our services. It was developed for Node.js and browser environments and already contains TypeScript type definitions. Please run `npm install @kontist/client` to install the latest version.

For details, please refer to [GitHub repository](https://github.com/kontist/sdk).
